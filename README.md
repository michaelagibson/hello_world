# hello_world
Trying to figure out how to use github. This repository is my github sandbox. It should largely be non-sensical for others, and definitely not useful.
 # About me
I am a materials scientist who loves data and programming. My primary language is mathematica, though I have been known to use python, R, and matlab as required. I am interested in using github to write a set of course notes and for drafting papers.
